# Custom WIP Jira Sub-Task Creator (updates by Nikolai)
I'm trying to change subtasks naming in this fork, and later creating a comprehensive way to edit subtasbs naming outside of sourcecode

March 29, 2022 Update. 
Index.html file was modified with new naming and new-subtasks added.
Basically this is the only thing, that's required for a minor custom changes.





# Jira Sub-Task Creator

As a Scrum Master, I had to manually create all the Sub-tasks for the Stories that were Ready for the Sprint.

The process takes some time, having to create 8-10 Sub-tasks for each Story (around 20 per Sprint), 
when 5-6 of them were Default Sub-tasks, the same for all stories. This (tedious) process was taking me around 1-2 hours per Sprint,
depending on the amount of Stories.

Having that in mind, I used the REST API call provided by Jira and created a Chrome Plug-in
where you can create all the sub-tasks for the Stories you need in just 1 click, cutting down the time spent on this to seconds.

## Pre-Reqs 

You need to be logged in Jira in order to the Plug-in to work.

When you are creating a new sub-task, DO NOT CLICK outside the plug-in, doing so will lose all your changes.

After clicking the CREATE button, wait for the timer to click away as Jira needs some seconds to process the request.
